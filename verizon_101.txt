At Verizon, many different promotions are available throughout the year that can allow you to get free or discounted smartphones, even from top brands like Apple, Samsung, Google and more. From new to certified pre-owned, Verizon can help in your search for a free cell phone.If you’re wondering how to get these great deals, start by exploring the multiple free phone promotion options that exist currently. Some promotions, like bringing your own device (BYOD) or trading-in your old smartphone, can allow you to bring over or trade your existing device for a brand new one, sometimes at no cost at all. Additionally, you can get a certified pre-owned (or, “CPO”) phone (including the latest Apple and Android devices) from Verizon sometimes at no cost, too, with applicable promotions. Finally, there are occasions when buy-one-get-one free phone promotions are running, which is another great way to save.To explore which phones are eligible for which promotions, you can browse Verizon’s smartphone deals.What else should I know about free phones?If you’re looking for government programs for free or reduced phones, there are options available for many individuals and households. In the modern age, having a cell phone that you and your family can rely on is essential, and programs like the Lifeline Assistance Program and Life Wireless can aid you in subsidizing a phone or phone service if you can’t cover the cost on your own.What’s more, those who qualify for other government programs like SNAP, Medicaid, and so forth may be eligible for other free phone programs, depending on the state you live in and your preferred cell phone service provider. No matter which brand you’re interested in, there is likely a free phone option available to you. From top brands like Apple, Samsung and Google to everything beyond, you can explore Verizon’s free phone promotions and deals year-round to learn which promotions you may be eligible for.

Have questions about Verizon’s Refer a Friend program? We’ve got answers. Who is eligible for Verizon's Referral program? Both current and new mobile customers can benefit from Verizon's Refer a Friend program. If you are already a Verizon customer, you can generate a code to send to up to 10 of your friends and family members who are not already Verizon customers and have not been with Verizon in the last 90 days. What do I need to do to refer a friend to Verizon and take advantage of the program? To refer a friend, you can generate a code to share with up to 10 people who are not already Verizon customers (and haven't been for at least 90 days). When they use the code to sign up for a new Verizon Unlimited postpaid line and keep that line active and in good standing for at least 30 days, you’ll get $15 off your monthly bills for a year. Referral codes may only be redeemed through a digital order on verizon.com or the My Verizon App. Refer a Friend rewards should appear on your bill in 1-2 bill cycles. What are the steps to get Refer a Friend credits? As the referring person, get started by using any device on your Verizon mobile phone plan to generate a Refer a Friend code: Visit the Refer a Friend dashboard in My Verizon. Click the generated code. Share the generated code with family and friends by text, email, QR code, link, etc. Each code is unique, can be used only once and expires after 60 days You can view the code's progress on the Refer a Friend dashboard. Your friend gets an invitation explaining their options to switch to Verizon with their referral code. They can use the link in the referral message to visit the Refer a Friend homepage and choose to either: Switch - Follow the prompts to change to Verizon and use their referral code. The Refer a Friend credit is applied to the new account's first bill. The credit may be prorated depending on when in the bill cycle they join. After your friend has service for 30 days, you get the first of your 12 monthly credits (the credit is applied within 1 or 2 bill cycles). Free Trial - Follow the prompts for a 30 day Free Trial of Verizon service. After the trial ends, your friend has 60 days to redeem the Refer a Friend code you sent and switch to Verizon. Learn more about Verizon's Free Trial. I've been referred to Verizon, what are my next steps? Referral codes may be redeemed through a digital order on verizon.com or via your dashboard on the My Verizon App. When you use your referral code to sign up for a line, and you have 30 days to activate an account before you start getting credits of $15 per month towards your monthly bill for 12 months. To receive your referral reward, you have to bring the phone number for at least 1 line on the account you set up (a "port-in" to Verizon), which hasn't been active on the Verizon network within the last 90 days. What are the benefits of referring someone to Verizon? As an existing customer, when you refer a friend to Verizon, you both save $15 per month off your bills for a year. That's $180 in savings. And since you can have up to 10 referrals, that means a max savings of $150/mo or $1,800/year! If you were sent a referral code as a new customer, then just use that code to join Verizon and save $15/mo for a year for each line you activate. Add up to 12 lines to save up to $2160/yr. Can I try the network before I accept the Verizon referral? Yes. You can try Verizon, America's most reliable 5G network* for 30 days, on us. You can keep your own eSIM-enabled device, phone number and current carrier. If you switch, you'll get your referral bonus. Just be sure to write down your referral code so it's handy when you’re ready to join. *Most reliable 5G network based on more first place rankings in RootMetrics® 5G data reliability assessments of 125 metro markets conducted in 1H 2023. Tested with best commercially available smartphones on three national mobile networks across all available network types. Your experiences may vary. RootMetrics rankings are not an endorsement of Verizon. What happens if my friend cancels their service before the yearly reward ends? Once they begin their plan, after their free trial period, you'll receive a credit on your bill, which should appear in 1-2 bill cycles. If they cancel or transfer away their line of service, you'll lose the referral reward associated with that line. And, sorry—referral rewards cannot be restored after they have been removed. What are some other Verizon programs that I can benefit from? At Verizon we have several programs aimed at helping people save on their bills. There are Senior Plans for customers aged 55 or over. There are also added programs available for groups like first responders, military and veterans, nurses, teachers and students. Verizon customers who are approved for the FCC's Affordable Connectivity Program can even get free Verizon Home Internet with the Verizon Forward Program. 1.

RootMetrics rankings are not an endorsement of Verizon. Have questions? We've got answers. What is the difference between 5G Ultra Wideband and 5G Nationwide? Verizon offers two types of 5G service: 5G Ultra Wideband and 5G Nationwide. 5G Ultra Wideband is Verizon's highest performing 5G. Our 5G Ultra Wideband network uses high band (mmWave) and mid-band (C-band) spectrum to deliver a top-of-the-line 5G experience. 5G Ultra Wideband provides game-changing benefits, like speeds up to 10x faster than what you have now. 5G Nationwide is the everyday 5G available across the country. It uses a low-band spectrum to provide great coverage with performance comparable to our award-winning 4G LTE, and is only getting better over time By deploying both technologies together alongside 4G, customers get an excellent, reliable network experience around the country. Where is 5G available? Verizon is constantly expanding their 5G coverage. We just expanded 5G Ultra Wideband and will cover more than 100M people in the first quarter of 2022. 5G Ultra Wideband has also been especially deployed in crowded locations so people can stream and share when connected, like in arenas, airports, and downtown cities and towns. We also provide 5G Nationwide service in over 2,700 markets. To see our current 5G coverage map, showcasing the cities and towns with 5G Nationwide and 5G Ultra Wideband, visit https://www.verizon.com/coverage-map/". What phones support 5G? We said we would lead on 5G, and we are. We were the first in the world to enable a commercial 5G mobile network with a commercially-available smartphone, the 5G moto mod. We currently provide the most 5G devices available on any 5G network. And we're committed to continuing to offer you the latest, most advanced models as we expand our 5G footprint nationwide. View our 5G-capable smartphones How do I know if my phone is 5G-compatible? If your phone is 5G-compatible, you should see a 5G icon in the top bar of your phone when you're in an area with 5G coverage. If you're not sure and you have an Android phone, tap on Settings >> Network & Internet >> Mobile Network >> Preferred Network type. You should see all the mobile network technologies that your phone supports such as 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G. If 5G is listed, then your phone supports it. Will 5G work on 4G phones? In order to access 5G service, you'll need a 5G-capable phone. For 5G Ultra Wideband service--which is available in select areas--you'll need to be inside a 5G Ultra Wideband coverage area and use a 5G Ultra Wideband-capable device with a 5G Ultra Wideband mobile plan. To access 5G Nationwide, which is available in 2,700+ cities, you'll need a 5G Nationwide-capable device, which automatically connects when you're in a 5G coverage area. Most devices manufactured in 2020 will require you to download a software update that adds the 5G Nationwide capability. View list of updates To see available 5G-capable Ultra Wideband* and 5G Nationwide** smartphones and devices, visit our 5G phones and devices page. 15G Ultra Wideband available in select areas. 5G Nationwide available in 2,700+ cities. 5G Nationwide access requires a 5G Nationwide-capable device. 5G Ultra Wideband access requires a 5G-capable device inside the 5G Ultra Wideband coverage area.

When purchasing a certified pre-owned phone, you won't just save money– you'll also be doing good for the environment by opting for a used phone.If you're in the market for a previously owned phone, it's important to know that anyone can sell an old device and call it a “used phone” or a “pre-owned phone.” That's why it's important to understand the difference between a used, refurbished, and certified pre-owned phone. At Verizon, “certified pre-owned” refers to the selection of pre-owned smartphones Verizon sells. These phones are refurbished phones that have been inspected and are in full working order, and come in a variety of conditions. For example, a device in “Great” condition may just have a few scratches and scuffs (but is still in perfect working order). If you're in the market for a refurbished iPhone, refurbished Samsung phone, and beyond, our certified pre-owned phones might be right for you.Free phones, and more used smartphone dealsWhen looking for a certified pre-owned phone, you may have cost savings on the top of your mind. At Verizon, we have a variety of great deals on smartphones, including certified pre-owned phones, free phones, and beyond.For example, if you're looking for a refurbished, certified pre-owned iPhone or Samsung phone, you can shop them all (and many more) at Verizon. Additionally, if you're looking to trade-in an old phone or bring your own device when switching to Verizon, you can do that, too. Simply visit our Trade-In or Bring Your Own Device pages to get started. There are plenty of ways to save on a smartphone when shopping at Verizon, and purchasing a certified pre-owned phone can be a cost-effective option for many.

You changed the charger after 10 years; most people don't have the one required or knew that you changed it. if you can't send a $3 cube for a $850 phone that's not saying much for your company.

Sep 4, 2023Is the galaxy 23 ultra waterproofAnswer this questionAnswer from Samsung1 monthSalutations Joanna, thanks for taking the available time out of your busy day to ask us your question about the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. No, the Galaxy S23 Ultra is not waterproof. It is, however, water and dust resistant based on an IP68 rating. This device was tested for submersion in fresh water deeper than 1.5 meters or keep it submerged for more than 30 minutes. If device is exposed to fresh water, dry it thoroughly with a clean, soft cloth; if exposed to liquid other than fresh water, rinse with fresh water and dry as directed. Let us know if you have any other questions for us by contacting Samsung Support. Thank you for being a faithful Samsung customer. - DebraWas this answer helpful?Yes (0)No (0)Report as inappropriateAnswer from Verizon Customer Support1 monthThe Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is IP68 rated. IP68 rating signifies that the Galaxy S23 Ultra is completely dustproof and can withstand being submerged in water for 30 minutes. The '6' in the IP rating stands for solid particle (i.e., dust) ingress protection. It's the highest level of solid particle protection, meaning the Galaxy S23 Ultra is completely dust-tight. ~PeterWas this answer helpful?Yes (0)No (0)Report as inappropriateSondra . Sep 2, 2023Is the Samsung galaxy s23 ultra water proof?Answer this questionAnswer from Samsung1 monthSalutations Sondra, thanks for taking the available time out of your busy day to ask us your question about the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. No. The Galaxy S23 is water and dust resistant. However, the S23 Ultra is not impervious to dust and water damage in any situation. It is important that all compartments are closed tightly. Follow these tips carefully to prevent damage to the device and maintain dust and water resistance performance: > Water resistant based on IP68 rating, which tests submersion in fresh water deeper than 1.5 meters or keep it submerged for more than 30 minutes. If device is exposed to fresh water, dry it thoroughly with a clean, soft cloth; if exposed to liquid other than fresh water, rinse with fresh water and dry as directed. > Any device which uses accessible compartments or ports that can be opened should have these sealed or closed tightly to prevent liquid from entering the system. > If the device has been immersed in water or the microphone or speaker is wet, sound may not be heard clearly during a call. After wiping the device with a dry cloth, dry it thoroughly before using it. > Do not expose the device to water at high pressure. > If the device is dropped or receives an impact, the water and dust resistant features of the device may be damaged. > If dust or foreign materials enter the microphone, speaker, or receiver, the device sound may become quiet or certain features may not work. If you attempt to remove the dust or foreign materials with a sharp object, the device may be damaged, and its appearance may be affected. > If the air vent hole is covered by an accessory of type, unwanted noises may occur during calls or media playback. NOTE: Liquid other than fresh water may enter the device faster. Failure to rinse the device in fresh water and dry it as instructed may cause the device to suffer from operability or cosmetic issues. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to Samsung Support. Thank you for being a faithful Samsung customer. - DebraWas this answer helpful?Yes (0)No (0)Report as inappropriateAnswer from Verizon Customer Support1 monthThe S23 Ultra has a water-resistance rating of IP68, which means your phone can be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes at a depth of 1.5 meters. Also, it is resistant to dust, dirt and if water droplets land on the screen. -JosephWas this answer helpful?Yes (0)No (0)Report as inappropriatePreviousPage 1 selected1Page 1 selected234Next Shop Devices Accessories Plans Home Internet & TV Deals TracFone Top Device Brands Samsung Apple Motorola Google Amazon Support Support overview Return policy Contact us Community Forums Sign in Download My Verizon App Lifeline Accessibility Check network status About Verizon About us Careers News Responsibility Verizon Innovative Learning Consumer info Articles Brochures Most Popular Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Apple iPhone 15 Plus Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra Apple AirPods Max Disney Apple Watch Series 9 Fios Verizon Visa® Card Top Accessory Brands Otterbox ZAGG Beats Mophie JBL Fitbit Gear 4 Important Consumer Information Terms & Conditions Device Payment Terms & Conditions Report a security vulnerability Mobile customer agreement Announcements Radio frequency emissions Taxes & surcharges Recall Legal notices Follow Verizon facebook-official twitter you-tube instagram Follow Verizon Fios facebook-official twitter Site Map Privacy Policy California Privacy Notice Your Privacy Choices Your Privacy Choices Accessibility Open Internet Terms & Conditions About Our Ads © 2023 Verizon

Known for their large, user-friendly touchscreens, these phones have become the mainstream model of communication in the modern day. These touchscreens, however strong they may be, don't always stand up to the inevitable drops, bumps and scratches that come with daily use; which is why you might need a screen protector.Screen protectors protect your device's screen from scratches, scuffs and bumps, and some are even antimicrobial (offering protection against germs) or come with tempered glass to protect your eyes from potentially harmful blue light rays. At Verizon, we offer a variety of screen protectors for all popular devices from Apple iPhones to Samsung Galaxys and more, in multiple finishes. That means you can choose the one that fits your personal needs, be it tempered glass, antimicrobial, plastic, or for privacy reasons.You can also buy screen protectors for your tablet. That way you can ensure all your devices are protected from the wear and tear of daily use (including when your kids take the tablet to play Minecraft, of course). Pair your screen protector with a new phone case and other accessoriesScreen protectors are one important way to protect your device from getting damaged, but having a solid phone case to protect the rest of your phone is equally important. From extra-durable picks like OtterBox phone cases that protect from hard falls and even water, to the stylish Kate Spade and Coach cases that pair well with any outfit, you're sure to be covered (and your cell phone protected) from drops, spills, and bumps wherever you go.If you're looking to save on a new phone case or screen protector, you may want to consider purchasing a phone case bundle. Bundles also typically come with a phone case and screen protector, which may be more economical than buying each accessory separately. Additionally, some phone case bundles even come with charging blocks and other helpful accessories you can pair with your device.Looking for other smartphone accessories? Verizon offers a wide variety of headphones, phone chargers, MagSafe products, and more to help you protect, charge, and use your device more efficiently.

Apple and their line of smartphones and other products took the mobile phone world by storm with the introduction of the first iPhone models in June 2007. A phone that was both easy to use and sleek in form made it an instant hit, and it's only gotten better ever since. You may know a lot about recent iPhone models, but do you know about the Magsafe technology available on iPhone 12 models and later?Originally intended to help users charge their Macbooks more efficiently, Magsafe introduced magnetic technology to iPhone that allows for fast, secure wireless charging (and much more). By adding these magnets to the internal engineering of iPhone, users can now simply lay their phones down onto a Magsafe charger and give their phone a battery boost in mere moments.This technology is proprietary to Apple, and can be used with other Apple products, too. Users can charge their AirPods with Magsafe chargers, as well as Macbooks and beyond. Magsafe chargers, wallets, cases, and moreNow that you know what Magsafe technology is, you may be wondering how to use them or how they'll improve your iPhone user experience. The Magsafe Wireless Charger, for example, is designed to quickly and safely charge your iPhone. The system intelligently adapts to conditions in order to optimize charging your iPhone at up to 15W of peak power delivery for faster wireless charging. There are also Magsafe battery packs available, which can be charged separately and snapped onto the back of your phone when you need a little more juice on the go. Magsafe wallets, on the other hand, use magnets to snap onto the back of your iPhone directly, or onto an iPhone case with Magsafe. Featuring a secure NFC chip which enables support for Find My, it can hold up to three cards, and it's shielded to keep them safe. However, it's important to note that in order to use an NFC-enabled card, such as a hotel key, you need to remove the card from the wallet.Additionally, Magsafe iPhone cases ensure that your phone can remain protected while still being able to connect to your magnetic accessories. These cases have magnets integrated into the back, which allows for the iPhone to securely snap directly onto a Magsafe case. The magnets in these cases also allow external Magsafe accessories, such as the wireless charger, to do the same. Apple has designed a line of these cases made of leather and silicone which come in a variety of colors, which you can shop now at Verizon.

However, if you're on an existing Mix & Match or Welcome Unlimited plan you can choose to switch one or all of your lines to myPlan at any time. All other plans must switch all of their lines if moving to myPlan. What are the differences between Unlimited Ultimate, Unlimited Plus and Unlimited Welcome? All of Verizon's Unlimited plans include unlimited talk, text, and data, as well as 5G (or 4G LTE in areas where 5G isn't available), Mexico and Canada talk, text and data, as well as International texting. With Unlimited Plus, you get our fastest 5G and access to 30 GB of Premium unlimited mobile hotspot data per month to power your other devices on the go. Unlimited Ultimate offers 60 GB premium hotspot data and unlimited calling and texting from 200+ countries. With Unlimited Ultimate you also get 10 GB international roaming data a month and the ability to turn on 1080p - 4G LTE/5G when you're streaming video. Check out our latest promotions and offers. Can I mix and match between Unlimited Ultimate, Unlimited Plus and Unlimited Welcome? Activating more than one line? If you'd like to choose Unlimited Ultimate or Unlimited Plus for some lines but Unlimited Welcome for others, you can do that. Just choose the plan you'd like for each specific line, for up to 12 lines, when you sign up for myPlan. Learn more. What are the benefits of adding a perk through Verizon? Save every month - check out the price savings on your favorite monthly subscriptions. Additionally, by adding perks to your plan through Verizon, you can manage those perks and subscriptions all in one place. For example, if you sign up for one of the available perk memberships, you can manage the membership through your Verizon bill and keep track of those charges all in one place. Will new perks be added? Yes– keep checking back for new, updated perks. Since you aren't locked in with myPlan to any specific contract, you can add new perks or change them at any time. Just one of the many benefits of our new Unlimited plans! What is data on a cell phone plan? When you aren't connected to Wi-Fi, you connect to the internet using data. So, if you're logging onto the web but not connected to Wi-Fi, your phone will require a data plan. This includes while using apps that require an internet connection, such as social media apps and certain mobile games, etc. What is an unlimited data plan? Some cell phone plans limit the amount of data you can use per month (measured in gigabytes, or "GB"), while an unlimited data plan doesn't limit you. It's an unlimited number of GBs. Depending on which plan you select, your speeds may be slower in times of congestion. Review your plan for details. What happens if I already have a subscription to a perk? It depends on the perk and the current subscription you have. You may need to manage your existing subscription to activate a perk. Please see the specific perk FAQs on what happens with existing subscriptions: Disney Bundle, Apple One, Apple Music, Walmart+, 2 TB Cloud Storage, Smartwatch Data & Safety and Three TravelPass Days perk FAQs.

We’ve got answers. What is a connected device plan? Can I get one for my device?

You can get a connected device plan(s) if your Verizon mobile account has either: No phone plans - you'll pay the "standalone" plan price Exception: To get our Essential or Plus plans for mobile hotspot devices and USB Modems your account must have at least one unlimited phone plan that can be mixed and matched**, One Unlimited for iPhone**, Unlimited Ultimate, Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Welcome. At least one unlimited mobile phone plan. Note: If you have a shared data plan***, you don't need a separate plan for your non-phone device because the device can share your plan's data. A $10/month line access fee is charged for each connected device sharing your monthly data. *Mobile hotspot devices are different from the mobile hotspot app or built-in feature in smartphones and tablets. Visit our Mobile hotspot feature and app FAQs to learn more. **These plans are no longer available to add to your account. ***Shared data plans are no longer available to add to your account. How many connected devices can I have on my Verizon mobile account? You can add up to 12 smartphones or basic phones to your Verizon mobile account with any plan that allows for multiple lines of service. And you can have up to 30 total devices per account. That means if you have 10 phone lines, you can have up to 20 connected devices (e.g., tablet, smartwatch, streaming camera, etc.). Note: If you have an unlimited monthly phone plan, each connected device must have its own data plan. If you have a shared data* monthly phone plan, the connected devices can share that data. *Shared data plans are no longer available to add to your account. How much does a connected device plan cost? Connected device plan monthly cost depends on: The connected device type (e.g, laptop, mobile hotspot device, smartwatch, etc.). Whether or not you already have any phones on an unlimited monthly mobile plan. How many non-phone devices you’re adding to your mobile account. The plan you choose.

Notice Regarding Transmission of Wireless Emergency Alerts (Commercial Mobile Alert Service) Verizon Wireless has chosen to offer wireless emergency alerts within portions of its service area, as defined by the terms and conditions of its service agreement, on wireless emergency alert capable devices. There is no additional charge for these wireless emergency alerts. Wireless emergency alerts may not be available on all devices or in the entire service area, or if a subscriber is outside of the Verizon Wireless service area. For details on the availability of this service and wireless emergency alert capable devices, please ask a sales representative, or go to www.verizon.com/support/wireless-emergency-alerts-faqs/. Data Services Verizon Wireless charges you for all data and content sent or received using our network (including any network overhead and/or Internet Protocol overhead associated with content sent or received) as well as resolution of Internet Protocol addresses from domain names. Sending or receiving data using a virtual private network (VPN) involves additional VPN overhead for which you will be charged. Please note that certain applications or widgets periodically send and receive data in the background, without any action by the user, and you will be billed for such data use. Applications may automatically re-initiate data sessions without your pressing or clicking the SEND, connect or Enter buttons. Data sessions automatically terminate after 24 hours. A data session is inactive when no data is being transferred. Data sessions may seem inactive while data is actively being transferred, or may seem active when the data is actually cached and data is not being transferred. If you have a Data Only plan and use voice service, domestic voice calls will be billed at $0.25/minute. Data transfer amounts will vary based on application. If you download an audio or video file, the file may be downloaded in sections or in its entirety; data charged will apply to the portion downloaded, regardless of whether you listen to or watch all of it. You may access and monitor your own data usage during a particular billing period, including during the Return Period, by accessing My Verizon online or by contacting Customer Service. Data Services: Permitted Uses. You can use our Data Services for accessing the Internet and for such uses as: (i) Internet browsing; (ii) email; (iii) intranet access (including accessing corporate intranets, email and individual productivity applications made available by your company); (iv) uploading, downloading and streaming of audio, video and games; and (v) Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Data Services: Prohibited Uses. You may not use our Data Services for illegal purposes or purposes that infringe upon others’ intellectual property rights, or in a manner that interferes with other users’ service; that violates trade and economic sanctions and prohibitions as promulgated by the departments of Commerce, Treasury or any other U.S. government agency; that interferes with the network’s ability to fairly allocate capacity among users. Examples of prohibited usage include: (i) server devices or host computer applications that are broadcast to multiple servers or recipients such that they could enable “bots” or similar routines (as set forth in more detail in (ii) below) or otherwise degrade network capacity or functionality; (ii) “auto–responders,” “cancel–bots,” or similar automated or manual routines that generate amounts of net traffic that could disrupt net user groups or e–mail use by others; (iii) generating “spam” or unsolicited commercial or bulk e–mail (or activities that facilitate the dissemination of such e–mail); (iv) any activity that adversely affects the ability of other users or systems to use either Verizon Wireless’ services or the Internet–based resources of others, including the generation or dissemination of viruses, malware, or “denial of service” attacks; (v) accessing, or attempting to access without authority, the information, accounts or devices of others, or to penetrate, or attempt to penetrate, Verizon Wireless’ or another entity’s network or systems; or (vi) running software or other devices that maintain continuous active Internet connections when a computer’s connection would otherwise be idle, or “keep alive” functions, unless they adhere to Verizon Wireless’ requirements for such usage, which may be changed from time to time. We further reserve the right to take measures to protect our network and other users from harm, compromised capacity or degradation in performance. These measures may impact your service, and we reserve the right to deny, modify or terminate service, with or without notice, to anyone we believe is using Data Plans or Features in a manner that adversely impacts our network. We may monitor your compliance, or the compliance of other subscribers, with these terms and conditions, but we will not monitor the content of your communications except as otherwise expressly permitted or required by law.

Wireless emergency alerts may not be available on all devices or in the entire service area, or if a subscriber is outside of the Verizon Wireless service area.

DATA SERVICES Verizon Wireless charges you for all data and content sent or received using our network (including any network overhead and/or Internet Protocol overhead associated with content sent or received) as well as resolution of Internet Protocol addresses from domain names. Sending or receiving data using a virtual private network (VPN) involves additional VPN overhead for which you will be charged. Please note that certain applications or widgets periodically send and receive data in the background, without any action by the user, and you will be billed for such data use. Applications may automatically re-initiate data sessions without your pressing or clicking the SEND, connect or Enter buttons. Data sessions automatically terminate after 24 hours. A data session is inactive when no data is being transferred. Data sessions may seem inactive while data is actively being transferred, or may seem active when the data is actually cached and data is not being transferred. If you have a Data Only plan and use voice service, domestic voice calls will be billed at $0.25/minute. Data transfer amounts will vary based on application. If you download an audio or video file, the file may be downloaded in sections or in its entirety; data charged will apply to the portion downloaded, regardless of whether you listen to or watch all of it. You may access and monitor your own data usage during a particular billing period, including during the Return Period, by accessing My Verizon online or by contacting Customer Service. Data Services: Permitted Uses. You can use our Data Services for accessing the Internet and for such uses as: (i) Internet browsing; (ii) email; (iii) intranet access (including accessing corporate intranets, email and individual productivity applications made available by your company); (iv) uploading, downloading and streaming of audio, video and games; and (v) Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Data Services: Prohibited Uses. You may not use our Data Services for illegal purposes or purposes that infringe upon others’ intellectual property rights, or in a manner that interferes with other users’ service; that violates trade and economic sanctions and prohibitions as promulgated by the departments of Commerce, Treasury or any other U.S. government agency; that interferes with the network’s ability to fairly allocate capacity among users. Examples of prohibited usage include: (i) server devices or host computer applications that are broadcast to multiple servers or recipients such that they could enable “bots” or similar routines (as set forth in more detail in (ii) below) or otherwise degrade network capacity or functionality; (ii) “auto–responders,” “cancel–bots,” or similar automated or manual routines that generate amounts of net traffic that could disrupt net user groups or e–mail use by others; (iii) generating “spam” or unsolicited commercial or bulk e–mail (or activities that facilitate the dissemination of such e–mail); (iv) any activity that adversely affects the ability of other users or systems to use either Verizon Wireless’ services or the Internet–based resources of others, including the generation or dissemination of viruses, malware, or “denial of service” attacks; (v) accessing, or attempting to access without authority, the information, accounts or devices of others, or to penetrate, or attempt to penetrate, Verizon Wireless’ or another entity’s network or systems; or (vi) running software or other devices that maintain continuous active Internet connections when a computer’s connection would otherwise be idle, or “keep alive” functions, unless they adhere to Verizon Wireless’ requirements for such usage, which may be changed from time to time. We further reserve the right to take measures to protect our network and other users from harm, compromised capacity or degradation in performance. These measures may impact your service, and we reserve the right to deny, modify or terminate service, with or without notice, to anyone we believe is using Data Plans or Features in a manner that adversely impacts our network. We may monitor your compliance, or the compliance of other subscribers, with these terms and conditions, but we will not monitor the content of your communications except as otherwise expressly permitted or required by law.

DATA SERVICES Verizon Wireless charges you for all data and content sent or received using our network (including any network overhead and/or Internet Protocol overhead associated with content sent or received) as well as resolution of Internet Protocol addresses from domain names. Sending or receiving data using a virtual private network (VPN) involves additional VPN overhead for which you will be charged. Please note that certain applications or widgets periodically send and receive data in the background, without any action by the user, and you will be billed for such data use. Applications may automatically re-initiate data sessions without your pressing or clicking the SEND, connect or Enter buttons. Data sessions automatically terminate after 24 hours. A data session is inactive when no data is being transferred. Data sessions may seem inactive while data is actively being transferred, or may seem active when the data is actually cached and data is not being transferred. If you have a Data Only plan and use voice service, domestic voice calls will be billed at $0.25/minute. Data transfer amounts will vary based on application. If you download an audio or video file, the file may be downloaded in sections or in its entirety; data charged will apply to the portion downloaded, regardless of whether you listen to or watch all of it. You may access and monitor your own data usage during a particular billing period, including during the Return Period, by accessing My Verizon online or by contacting Customer Service.

Switch to Verizon Home Internet. Check your new home’s address to find available home internet plans and features. Check availability Three simple steps to get moving. 1. Check availability. Enter your address and find out what internet service is available to you. 2. Select your plan. Choose the right plan built for your needs and take advantage of our offers. 3. Place your order. Order online and install your way. Have questions? We’ve got answers. Can I move my current Verizon Home Internet service to a new address? Verizon has made it easy for you to stay connected while you start your new adventure. For existing Fios customers, please click here to sign in to your account. For existing 5G Home Internet or LTE Home Internet customers, please click here to sign in to your account. We'll help you find out if we offer internet service at your new home and how to transfer it if we do. What internet is available at my address? For Verizon Home Internet availability, it's all about the internet technology, how it's delivered to your home and where you live. Fios provides 100% fiber-optic internet with supercharged speeds and is widely available in metro and suburban areas of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. 5G Home Internet is now in more and more places around the country and is fast, reliable home internet so you can game, stream and connect the way you want. LTE Home Internet uses the wireless 4G LTE network to deliver home broadband internet service to your residence. To see which Verizon home internet service is available where you live, check availability. I'm moving and Verizon internet is available at my new address. Do I need to pay an installation fee? You're in luck. For 5G Home and LTE Home service, you can set up the equipment on your own, at no cost. In some areas, 5G Home professional assistance may be available for an additional charge. To transfer your Fios internet service to a new home, log in to your account to let us know that you will be moving. There may be an installation or setup charge when your new service is installed. When should I set up Verizon Home Internet at my new home? We recommend placing your order for Fios internet service two weeks in advance of moving into your new home, and we're here to make the process fast and easy. If you've already moved in, you can get started right now. Verizon offers evening and weekend appointments (in most areas) for Fios. Equipment for 5G Home and LTE Home will be sent to you for self-setup. It may take 2-4 days to arrive after you place your order. What internet speed do I need when I’m moving to a new home? Your ideal internet speed will depend on how you are using the internet. According to a 2021 Deloitte survey, the average household has 25 devices connected to their Wi-Fi network. Each device you add will use some of your internet bandwidth, and some devices (like home security devices or smart home devices) function in the background without you thinking about them. This is why review sites like Tom's Guide recommend you get an internet speed of 200 Mbps or higher if your household has more than one person, or if you like to game or stream content. Does Verizon Home Internet participate in the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP)? Yes. The ACP is a federal program that provides subsidized internet service for eligible customers. ACP qualified customers can get: Up to one $30/month subsidy for each eligible household Up to one $75/month subsidy for each eligible household on Tribal lands If you qualify for ACP, the subsidy can be applied to your Verizon Home Internet plan. Both new and existing customers can take advantage of it. Learn more. HomePod on us Get a HomePod on us. Terms and conditions apply.* *For eligible new res. custs.

If you're interested in smart home devices and technology, you may be wondering where to start, or how to integrate your devices into one true smart home ecosystem. To begin, you can start by narrowing down a brand you'd like to base your home environment around. If you're interested in using Amazon's Alexa, for example, you might want to shop for other smart home tech from Amazon, including Echo devices that can control your whole home hub, Amazon streaming devices, and beyond. Additionally, some products, like Ring doorbells, can work with a variety of brands and will integrate seamlessly with whichever products you choose. Google products are also a great place to start when integrating your home's technology, with home hubs, speakers, and cameras. Control your home's thermostat, keep an eye on your family or pets with high tech cameras, or make smart reminders with Google's suite of smart home products. Smart home security for peace of mindIf you're looking for efficient, innovative ways to protect your home, smart home security devices can be a huge help. Security cameras, smart doorbells, and other new devices make protecting your home a breeze, even when you're not there. Doorbells with cameras that sync with your cell phone, for example, can help you see who's at your door (even if you're far from home). Other cameras can be installed and integrated into your smart home ecosystem as well, giving you a wide coverage area of your home both indoors and outside. If you're ready to start building your smart home ecosystem, you can shop our wide selection of security cameras, smart home hubs, and more any time at Verizon. And, if you're looking to save money, you can browse our product deals to get new connected tech and accessories at a great price.
